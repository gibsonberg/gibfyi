# About

I'm Gibson Berg and this is my personal website. As of writing this, it takes the form of a blog.
I intend to eventually write some brief articles here, and use this website as a way of accessing
various files and other resources I want to make public. I'll probably also end up using this just
for fun, adding non-serious articles and secrets and whatnot.

I'm currently in undergrad studying Civil Engineering at the University of Minnesota. I have
particular interest in urban mobility, and intend to focus primarily on transportation, ideally
pedestrian, bicycle, and rail infrastructure. I'm also interested in learning more about
[Intelligent Transportation Systems.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_transportation_system)

This website was built using [Cao Lente's](https://lente.dev/en/) theme [Bear Cub](https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub)
for [Hugo.](https://gohugo.io/)

Feel free to contact me by [email](mailto:berg@gib.fyi) for whatever reason. While I do have accounts
on various social media platforms, I generally prefer to keep those to personal uses only.
