This is the initial test landing/home page for my personal website/blog/whatever. Created using
[Caio lente's](https://lente.dev/en) awesome, lightweight [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme
*Bear Cub*.

This is an example of **bold text**!

I probably intend on fucking with the style sheet more than what I've done so far (changing the primary
font and background color) once I've learned a little more CSS. Some things I would like to do include:

* Adding a different, complimentary font for titles/major headings,
* Changing how those links up top look, maybe,
* and whatever else I need to figure out. I just included this to have a 3-point list.

I'll have to read more about [this markdown](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/) and play around with it.
It would certainly be fun to take some photos and include them here every once in a while, too.

Maybe eventually I will add a Spanish portion of this site, since this theme makes bilingual pages easy,
but that will be a future endeavor.
