# About

I'm Gibson Berg and this is my personal website.

I am a Civil Engineer located in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
I'm most interested in urban mobility, especially public transit and active transportation.

Eventually, I hope to use this website to host my thoughts in a more nuanced and intimate manner than social media is often able to afford.
In addition, I intend to make various files and other resources such as digitized records and photos available through this site.

This website was built using [Cao Lente's](https://lente.dev/en/) theme [Bear Cub](https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub) for [Hugo.](https://gohugo.io/)

Feel free to contact me by [email](mailto:berg@gib.fyi) for any reason.
